                <p>I am a professional web developer with nearly four years of experience and have
                    recently relocated to Adelaide while starting a family. I hold a Bachelor of Technology in
                    computing from RMIT University. I am seeking to leverage my education and solid
                    experience to obtain a position in web development and return to my career.
